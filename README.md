# International Product Bidding Platform

This platform facilitates seamless international product transactions through a dynamic bidding system. It empowers customers to submit requests and producers to place competitive bids, while integrating advanced features like machine learning-powered pricing recommendations, metadata security through Reversible Data Hiding (RDH), and real-time communication tools.

## Features
- **Request Submission**: Customers specify product details and budgets via an intuitive ReactJS interface.
- **Bidding System**: Producers bid competitively on customer requests, managed by a scalable backend using Node.js, AWS Lambda, and MongoDB.
- **Pricing Recommendation**: Machine learning analyzes bid data, market trends, and seasonal demand to suggest optimal pricing.
- **Reversible Data Hiding (RDH)**: Secures sensitive metadata like invoices by embedding it into digital assets without extra storage overhead.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with ReactJS and integrated with tools like D3.js or Chart.js for visualizing bidding trends, pricing, and metrics.
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebRTC and Socket.io enable live chat and video conferencing for seamless interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures accessibility across devices with a mobile-friendly UI.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: ReactJS for user interface development
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for server-side logic
- **Scalability**: AWS Lambda for handling dynamic bidding processes
- **Database**: MongoDB for real-time bid storage and retrieval
- **Machine Learning**: Predictive models to recommend optimal pricing
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js or Chart.js for insights into bidding and performance metrics
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebRTC and Socket.io for live chat and video conferencing
- **Metadata Security**: Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) for embedding sensitive metadata in digital assets
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization and AWS for hosting services
